Things that we have to do :

- Add Search activity + controller

- (IMPOSSIBLE, my PHP server is not up-to-date) Encrypt password before sending it by POST Method (instead of implemanting https)

- (DONE) Add protection against brute force ; block user account (10 tries per day)

- (DONE) Implements SQLite DB (we will use transition activity (after the login one) to populate our SQLite DB list from MySql DB)

- (The same) Change password protection : 
  1. Receive hash (sha256) password from android (generated by Java) 
  2. Generate random salt for each studiant 
  3. Concatenate password with this pattern : salt.hashPassword.salt
  4. Hash the result with sha256

- Change the Logo by a new one
