Things that we have to do :

- Add Search activity + controller

- Encrypt password before sending it by POST Method (instead of implemanting https)

- Add protection against brute force ; block user by their IP instead of their login (this solution protects from kiddies who want to block all account by giving wrong password)

- (DONE) Implements SQLite DB (we will use transition activity (after the login one) to populate our SQLite DB list from MySql DB)

- Change password protection : 
  1. Receive hash (sha256) password from android (generated by Java) 
  2. Generate random salt for each studiant 
  3. Concatenate password with this pattern : salt.hashPassword.salt
  4. Hash the result with sha256

- Change the Logo by a new one
